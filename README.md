This repository is for the demonstration codes for the project that implements machine learning techniques on the measurement of Higgs properties. The complete set of events is not included here due to its large size. However, interested people can generate the events easily from PYTHIA/HERWIG. 

The project using Convolutional Neural Network can be found in arXiv:1901.09391.
